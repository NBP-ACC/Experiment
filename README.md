# Experiment

### Overview

This code implements a simple go/no-go task using pygame. However, there are some gaps that you have to fill in order to make the experiment run (lines ??? - wait for updated code). After you got the experiment to run, collect some data from your fellow students and/or friends. The analysis we will do in the next two weeks will be based on this data.


### Go/no-go Task

In a go/no-go task the participant is required to react given a “go” stimulus and refrain from reacting given a “no-go” signal. In psychology this experiment paradigm is often used to measure impulsiveness and sustained attention.
